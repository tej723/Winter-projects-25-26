This is a fairly reasonable solution, and we use it to normalize the neural network's input. Now imagine the goal is to normalize some intermediate values in a deep neural network; Collecting values of some intermediate point in a neural network is almost impossible since the training algorithm can change them entirely. To overcome this issue, we can collect them over a mini-batch.  It will give us an estimated version of the mean and variance. This is why it is called Batch Normalization.

In the baseline model, the output of the convolution which can vary wildly in scale is fed directly into the ReLU activation, whereas in the improved model, the Batch Normalization layer intercepts that output first, centering and stabilizing the data distribution before the activation function ever sees it. This actually makes the standard bias term in the convolution redundant, effectively replacing it with the batch norm’s own learnable parameters, $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$, which give the network more control over the data's scale and shift. Consequently, the improved model typically converges much faster than the baseline, achieving higher accuracy in fewer epochs. By normalizing the inputs to each layer, the model effectively \"tames\" the training process, preventing the optimizer from having to constantly chase shifting data distributions. This results in a smoother loss landscape, allowing the network to use higher learning rates without diverging and making the overall training process significantly more stable and efficient compared to the baseline.}}$"
