Now imagine the goal is to normalize some intermediate values in a deep neural network; Collecting values of some intermediate point in a neural network is almost impossible since the training algorithm can change them entirely.

It is observed that the loss curves in the batch-normalized model are smoother and more stable compared to those of the baseline model. This makes the training process insensitive to initialization variables, and the backpropagation of gradients also works well. This leads to the batch-normalized model being more stable and having faster convergence compared to the baseline model.\n",
