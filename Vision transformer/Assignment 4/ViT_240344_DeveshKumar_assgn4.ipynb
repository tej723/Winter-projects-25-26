This is a fairly reasonable solution, and we use it to normalize the neural network's input. Now imagine the goal is to normalize some intermediate values in a deep neural network; Collecting values of some intermediate point in a neural network is almost impossible since the training algorithm can change them entirely. To overcome this issue, we can collect them over a mini-batch.  It will give us an estimated version of the mean and variance. This is why it is called Batch Normalization.

By normalizing the inputs to each layer, we reduce the \"Internal Covariate Shift,\" which allows the optimizer to use higher learning rates without instability. Additionally, BN acts as a slight regularizer, often leading to better generalization and higher test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the baseline model."
