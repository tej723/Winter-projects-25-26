        "Humanity has colonized the distant exoplanet *Kepler-186f*. While the surface is habitable, the planet's magnetic core is unstable. The **Global Defense Council (GDC)** has identified a dangerous phenomenon known as the **\"Radiation Ring.\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "Sensors indicate that the safe zones on the planet follow a peculiar geometry:\n",
        "* ⚫ **The Core Zone:** Distance $< 2$ km from the colony center (Safe).\n",
        "* ⚫ **The Outer Wilds:** Distance $> 4$ km from the colony center (Safe).\n",
        "* ⚫ **The Dead Zone:** The region **between 2 km and 4 km** is flooded with lethal gamma radiation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your engineering team has deployed **3,000 sensor drones** across the colony to map this danger. Each drone reports its coordinates $(x, y)$ and a binary label:\n",
        "* `1`: Radiation Detected (Dead Zone)\n",
        "* `0`: Safe Zone\n",
        "\n",
        " **⚫ The Problem:** The sensors are cheap and prone to interference. Approximately **5%** of the drones are malfunctioning and reporting the wrong safety status (noise). The GDC mainframe is a legacy system that forbids the use of modern \"Neural Libraries\" (i.e., you cannot use `torch.nn` or `torch.optim`). You must build a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch** to filter out the noise and mathematically define the Exclusion Zone boundaries using **PyTorch**. ( Hint: You know this is a binary classification problem, which Loss function would you use?? )\n",

        "2.  **Architect the Filter:** Construct a neural network with **3 hidden layers** (16 neurons each) to learn the non-linear \"donut\" shape of the Dead Zone.\n",
        "3.  **Manual Calibration:** You cannot use auto-optimizers. You must manually calculate the gradients (Backpropagation) and update the system weights using **Gradient Descent**.\n",
        "4.  **Verify Integrity:** Split your sensor data (70% training, 30% validation). Prove that your system doesn't just memorize the malfunctioning sensors (overfitting) but actually learns the geometric shape of the Dead Zone.\n",
