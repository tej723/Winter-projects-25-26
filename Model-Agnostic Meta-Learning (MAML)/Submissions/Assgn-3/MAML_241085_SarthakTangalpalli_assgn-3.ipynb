        "Answer 1:\n",
        "Strategy 3 (Pre-train on All 10 Digits) is the most appropriate strategy. A neural network is essentially a 'feature extractor' followed by a classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random Initialization (Strategy 1) is generally suboptimal because just 5-10 support images are not enough to learn complex visual features (edges, curves, loops) from scratch without generalizing poorly due to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transfer from Task A (Strategy 2) is better than Random Initialization but is alsobiased as it knows features for digits '0' & '1', which are basically 'ovals & lines', but not necessarily for '2 or 3', which require 'open curves', for example. Transfer from All 10 (Strategy 3) is the best transfer strategy for transfer learning as it has already learned to extract all possible shapes necessary to differentiate one number from another. Its only requirement is to just remap the existing features to work for new labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 2: Although this model has previously viewed the digits 2 and 3, a fine-tuning process needs to occur to account for Classifier Heads.\n",

        " Initially, this trained model had a 10-way output head. For this novel instance, a random binary 2-way output head has been employed. This random binary head has been randomly initialized, and this binary head does not have a clue that a category of \"Output 0\" has to be related to the feature of a \"2\".\n",

        " Here, this process of fine-tuning targets mainly adapting its weights to connect proper existing feature channels of a frozen backbone to a novel output category by enforcing a mapping rule.\n",

        " Answer 3: Absolutely, and this will be much better than random initialization, although perhaps not as effective as Letter-to-Letter Transfer.\n",

        " The first layers of a CNN learn universal visual feedback such as Gabor filters (edges, corners, lines). An edge in letter letter 'A' vs letter letter '4' will look exactly the same to a mathematical machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Layers down the line that catch things such as loops of 0, 8, and 9 lend themselves to be reused for catching letters that have loops, such as letters B, P, and D. For this method to be successful, you would need to freeze the early convolutional layers to lock in universal feature detectors and just fine-tune on the later layers.\n",

        "  Answer 4: Technically speaking, we have not employed a Meta-Learning Algorithm, but we operate under the Meta-Learning problem setting.\n",
        "  We are trying out ideas from the Meta-Learning literature on the Support/Query set format to see how fast a model Learns a new task with very little data. The approaches we employed to address the problem are traditional ones for Transfer Learning—Random Init/Pre-training.\n",
        "  We did not apply any Meta-Learning optimization strategy particular to Learning how the model learns. Pre-train an example model and hope for the best is all we did for Meta-Learning. MAML does the same but optimizes the initial Weights better.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Answer 5: “Yes, and I think that’s the philosophical point of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) in particular. Let’s assume there’s a valley in the loss space for the weights of the ‘Digit’ classification, and some other ‘valley’ for the weights of Letter.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The way traditional Transfer Learning works is that it places you at a ‘depth in one of these valleys,’ making it very difficult to climb out of in order for you to get over to the other valley.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  What MAML tries to find is where the weights of initialization are on the “ridge” connecting the two valleys. It’s not saying the initialization weights are near 100% for digits and near 90% for letters in the first place (high loss), but rather in a way where a very small step in one direction puts it in the digit valley and in the letter valley for a step in the opposite direction.”"
