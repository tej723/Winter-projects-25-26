        "# **Assignment Roadmap**\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment asks you to build a complete Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) pipeline. Your goal is to take raw, noisy electrical brain signals and turn them into a clear Yes/No decision: Is this the character the user wants?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Theres not much theory to learn other than implementation, you have to learn this by doing**\n",
        "\n",
        "## AI Usage Policy for This Assignment\n",
        "\n",
        "You're welcome to use AI for this assignment. Given the complexity of EEG signal processing and machine learning,\n",
        "We don't expect you to know every implementation detail from scratch and neither does any recuiter or any professor.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Use AI to:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Debug errors and troubleshoot issues\n",
        "\n",
        "    Understand concepts and explore different approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "What matters:\n",
        "\n",
        "    You understand your code and can explain how it works\n",
        "\n",
        "    You learn from the process, not just copy-paste\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1: Cleaning the Signal (Preprocessing)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Goal: Raw EEG data is full of \"garbage\" frequencies like muscle movement and electrical hum. You need to filter the data to keep only the brain waves relevant to the P300 response (typically 0.1Hz – 20Hz).\n",
        "\n",
        "You have already done this in the previous assignment but this one is a more standard procedure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Pitfalls:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Filter Lag: Standard filters can delay the signal, meaning the brain response looks like it happened later than it actually did. To prevent this, use zero-phase filtering (e.g., scipy.signal.filtfilt) instead of standard filtering (lfilter).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Aliasing: You are asked to downsample the data from 240Hz to 60Hz to make it faster to process. Do not simply slice the array (e.g., data[::4]) without filtering first. If you do, high-frequency noise will \"fold over\" into your low frequencies and corrupt the data. Always filter before downsampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2: Epoch Extraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Goal: You need to convert the continuous stream of data into specific \"events\" or \"epochs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The Concept: A P300 response happens roughly 300ms after a flash. Your code needs to identify every moment a flash occurs (stimulus_onset), look forward in time (e.g., 800ms), and \"snip\" that window of data out.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualizing the Data Structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Input: A continuous 2D matrix (Total_Time_Points, 64_Channels)\n",
        "\n",
        "    Output: A 3D block of events (Number_of_Flashes, Time_Points_Per_Window, 64_Channels)\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Pitfall:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Indexing Errors: This dataset may originate from MATLAB (which uses 1-based indexing), while Python uses 0-based indexing. If your index calculation is off by even one sample, your window will shift, and the machine learning model will be training on random noise rather than the brain response. Double-check your start and end indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3: Making Data \"Model-Ready\" (Feature Engineering)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Goal: Standard Machine Learning models (like SVM or LDA) cannot understand 3D arrays. They generally require a 2D matrix (like an Excel sheet). The Task:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Time Domain: You will need to \"flatten\" the epochs. If an epoch is 60 time points × 64 channels, it becomes a single flat row of 3,840 numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "    PCA/CSP: These are compression techniques. The goal is to reduce those 3,840 numbers down to perhaps 20 numbers that capture the most important information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Pitfall:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Data Leakage: When using PCA or CSP, you must be careful not to \"cheat.\" You should .fit() your reducer only on the training data, and then .transform() the test data. If you fit on the combined dataset, your model \"sees\" the test answers ahead of time, leading to artificially high scores that won't work in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4: Classification**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Goal: Feed your features into the ML models (LDA, SVM, etc.) provided in the skeleton code to classify \"Target\" vs. \"Non-Target\" flashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Pitfall:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Class Imbalance: In a P300 speller, the letter the user wants (Target) only flashes 1 out of 6 times. The other 5 flashes are Non-Targets.\n",
        "\n",
        "        If your model decides to simply guess \"Non-Target\" every single time, it will still achieve ~83% accuracy. This is a useless model.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Do not rely solely on Accuracy. Check the F1-Score or the Confusion Matrix. A good model must be able to correctly identify the rare Target events, not just the frequent Non-Targets."
